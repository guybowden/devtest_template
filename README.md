# MBA Developer Test template

This is a stub project to get started quickly for the developer test

## The Task

We would like you to create a very simple JSON REST API for a "product", plus a single page app to **display a list** of products and **add** products.

The product model should include at least a name and a description.

**This task should take no more than 2 hours to complete**

## Requirements

The end result should be emailed as a zip file (not posted to GitHub!), along with a link to the running example on a web server.

You are free to choose where to host the finished app, but this stub contains a `Procfile` and `requirements.txt` that can be used on **Heroku** to easily deploy if you choose.

## Tools

You are free to choose the frameworks for both front and backend development, however, you MUST use a recognised django REST api framework (django-rest-framework, tastypie, piston etc), and a Javascript MVC framework (backbonejs, ember, spine etc) rather than trying to implement the JSON directly and manipulating it with straight javascript AJAX calls.

This stub contains an HTML file that loads in everything needed for a Backbonejs app, but feel free to use what you like.
